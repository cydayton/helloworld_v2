My initial intentions when designing my Hello World sketch were to learn some new and interesting skills while creating a visually pleasing page.  Naturally, I chose to play around with a picture from St. Martin, which is also the home screen on my computer.  However, after diving deeper into the meaning of my sketch, I realized that I resorted to this picture because it brings peace and ease to my mind.  The calm scene reminds me of relaxing vacations with my beloved family that I cherished so much during high school.  All of the elements that I added to my sketch were an effort to accentuate the comforting vibe that I always feel when looking at this picture.  It is my hope that viewers gain a similar sense of contentment when interacting with my sketch even if they cannot relate to the setting.  In this second version of my sketch, I wanted to show the viewer more about the memories I have sailing and exploring.  My favorite part about sailing is the emphasis on simple living and the beauty of nature.  Although intimate, a small cabin below deck is more than enough to live comfortably.  We spent most of our time enjoying the sun and breeze above deck and immersing ourselves in the local culture on shore.  The image on the left is a farmer's market on Union Island with basic yet incredible and wholesome fruit stands.  On the right, the "boat boys", groups who travel by dinghy at Tobago Keys, are setting up a picnic dinner on the island.  My family learned to understand the "island time" atmosphere where no one was ever in a rush or ever seemed anxious.  I hoped to share and emphasize the humble lifestyle surrounded by stunning scenery that I grew up appreciating so much.
